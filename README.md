# PANA-FSDS-GROUP
The reproducible analysis must be a runnable QMD (Quarto Markdown Document) file that addresses the set questions provided in class. The QMD file will be assessed on two components:

Its **content** (60% of this assessment): do the answers written by the group engage through a mix of literature, critical thinking, and data analysis with the set questions?
Its **reproducibility** (40% of this assessment): do the analyses employed, and outputs created by the group run fully and without errors on a different computer, and do they show evidence of thought in relation to the quality of coding and outputs?
